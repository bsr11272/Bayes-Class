## Introduction

The Naive Bayes classifiers are probabilistic algorithms commonly used for classification tasks. They are based on the Bayes' theorem and make assumptions about the independence of features given the class.
## Dependencies

This implementation requires the following dependencies:

- Python 
- NumPy 
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results can be visualized using plots or tables to provide a better understanding of the model's behavior.
